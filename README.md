# Sailor Daily Plus
Sailor Moon themed watchface for Pebble watch/steel (Aplite). Smartwatch+ required. Seems to work ok on Timeline.

It should be compatible with Pebble time too but obviously black and white.

Each day of the week the watchface will theme itself around a Sailor Guardian:
- Monday is Sailor Moon
- Tuesday is Sailor Mars
- Wednesday is Sailor Mercury
- Thursday is Sailor Jupiter
- Friday is Sailor Venus
- Saturday is Sailor Saturn
- Sunday is Sailor Pluto
 
You may vertically shake your watch to manually cycle through. The watchface will reset itself on the daily theme at midnight when the day changes or by restarting the watchface.

Watchface also vibrates respectively once and twice on reaching 80% or 100% when charging phone, and on reaching 40% or 20% when discharging phone to notify about phone battery status.

The Sailor Guardian symbols are my own pixel art pictures.
Background assets are pixel art pictures inspired from various sources redrawn by hand by me. The original pictures/ideas are not mine though, feel free to write to me if you think it is an issue.
